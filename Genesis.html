    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <p class="top-container"> <sup>1</sup> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. <sup>2</sup> Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.

<sup>3</sup> And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. <sup>4</sup> God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. <sup>5</sup> God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.

<sup>6</sup> And God said, “Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water.” <sup>7</sup> So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so. <sup>8</sup> God called the vault “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day.

<sup>9</sup> And God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.” And it was so. <sup>10</sup> God called the dry ground “land,” and the gathered waters he called “seas.” And God saw that it was good.

<sup>11</sup> Then God said, “Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.” And it was so. <sup>12</sup> The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. <sup>13</sup> And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day.

<sup>14</sup> And God said, “Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years, <sup>15</sup> and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth.” And it was so. <sup>16</sup> God made two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. <sup>17</sup> God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth, <sup>18</sup> to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. <sup>19</sup> And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day.

<sup>20</sup> And God said, “Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky.” <sup>21</sup> So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. <sup>22</sup> God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.” <sup>23</sup> And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day.

<sup>24</sup> And God said, “Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according to its kind.” And it was so. <sup>25</sup> God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.

<sup>26</sup> Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals,[a] and over all the creatures that move along the ground.”

<sup>27</sup> So God created mankind in his own image,
    in the image of God he created them;
    male and female he created them.

<sup>28</sup> God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.”

<sup>29</sup> Then God said, “I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. <sup>30</sup> And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground—everything that has the breath of life in it—I give every green plant for food.” And it was so.

<sup>31</sup> God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
  <p class="top-container"><sup>1</sup>So the heavens and the earth were completed, and all that is in them. <sup>2</sup> On the seventh day God ended His work which He had done. And He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done. <sup>3</sup> Then God honored the seventh day and made it holy, because in it He rested from all His work which He had done.

The Garden of Eden
<sup>4</sup> This is the story of the heavens and the earth when they were made, in the day the Lord God made the earth and the heavens. <sup>5</sup> Now no bush of the field was yet on the earth. And no plant of the field had started to grow. For the Lord God had not sent rain upon the earth. And there was no man to work the ground. <sup>6</sup> But a fog came from the earth and watered the whole top of the ground. <sup>7</sup> Then the Lord God made man from the dust of the ground. And He breathed into his nose the breath of life. Man became a living being. <sup>8</sup> The Lord God planted a garden to the east in Eden. He put the man there whom He had made. <sup>9</sup> And the Lord God made to grow out of the ground every tree that is pleasing to the eyes and good for food. And He made the tree of life grow in the center of the garden, and the tree of learning of good and bad.

<sup>10</sup> Now a river flowed out of Eden to water the garden. And from there it divided and became four rivers. <sup>11</sup> The name of the first is Pishon. It flows around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold. <sup>12</sup> The gold of that land is good. Bdellium and onyx stone are there. <sup>13</sup> The name of the second river is Gihon. It flows around the whole land of Cush. <sup>14</sup> The name of the third river is Tigris. It flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.

<sup>15</sup> Then the Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work the ground and care for it. <sup>16</sup> The Lord God told the man, “You are free to eat from any tree of the garden. <sup>17</sup> But do not eat from the tree of learning of good and bad. For the day you eat from it you will die for sure.”

<sup>18</sup> Then the Lord God said, “It is not good for man to be alone. I will make a helper that is right for him.” <sup>19</sup> Out of the ground the Lord God made every animal of the field and every bird of the sky. He brought them to the man to find out what he would call them. And whatever the man called a living thing, that was its name. <sup>20</sup> Adam gave names to all the cattle, and to the birds of the sky, and to every animal of the field. But there was no helper found that was right for Adam. <sup>21</sup> So the Lord God put the man to sleep as if he were dead. And while he was sleeping, He took one of the bones from his side and closed up the place with flesh. <sup>22</sup> The Lord God made woman from the bone which He had taken from the man. And He brought her to the man. <sup>23</sup> The man said, “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She will be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.” <sup>24</sup> For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother, and will be joined to his wife. And they will become one flesh. <sup>25</sup> The man and his wife were both without clothes and were not ashamed.</p>
